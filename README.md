# gherkin

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/podnov/gherkin.svg?branch=master)

Some quick gherkin stuff. A parser and a formatter. The formatter currently only formats data tables as that's the most annoying thing for me to manually manage. The formatter can be invoked using the gherking-formatter-maven-plugin.
